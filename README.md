## Annualised Sharpe Calculator

This is a simple calculator to calculate the annualised sharpe ratio of a given `ticker` for a given period, denoted by `start_date` and `end_date`.

The calculator uses `yfinance` to download the historical data of the `ticker`. Workings on how the Annualised Sharpe Ratio is calculated can be viewed in the provided [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jeromeandrewong/stock-repository-calculator/blob/main/sharpe.ipynb).
